# 🐍 Python Development Laboratory

Welcome to my personal code laboratory! 🚀

This repository serves as a centralized archive for my Python development journey. Instead of scattering small projects across multiple repositories, I maintain them here to document my progress, experiments, and reusable code modules.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* **Experimentation:** Testing new libraries, APIs, and architectural patterns.
* **Documentation:** Keeping a record of solved problems and implemented algorithms.
* **Modularity:** Building reusable backend components (Auth systems, Data fetchers, etc.) for future larger projects.

## 📂 Architecture & Categories

This repository is organized into logical directories based on the concept, not just individual files:

* **🔌 API Integrations:** Scripts interacting with external REST APIs (e.g., TMDB, Weather Services).
* **🔐 Authentication & Security:** Backend simulations for user management, login/register flows, and data persistence.
* **💾 Data Structures & Algorithms:** Efficient solutions to common programming problems.
* **⚙️ Automation:** Tools designed to automate repetitive tasks.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Key Concepts:** OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), RESTful Services, JSON Handling, File I/O.
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub Best Practices.
